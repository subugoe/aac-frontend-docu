## Views

- **XL-L** – Tablet (Landscape mode), Notebook and Desktop
- **M** – Tablet (Portrait mode)
- **S** – Phone

> When talking about views we refer to them as XL-S instead of desktop, tablet etc. because size (or form factor) doesn't imply anything usefull really… a **M View** might be a rather big iPad Pro which is used by touch or it might be a rather small keyboard/mouse dependend MacBook Air.
